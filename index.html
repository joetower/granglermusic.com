						<h2>Origin, passion, reasoning</h2>
						<p>For the last 8 years, I’ve been poring over my favorite albums, artists, songs of the year and compiling
							a pair of CDRs to gift to family and friends for the holiday season. This was a bit of a <em>passing of
								the torch s</em>o-to-speak, in that my uncle Steve used to compile CDRs as his annual gift. Steve passed
							away 8 years ago, so I’ve been assembling my own compilations; both as a tribute to him and because I
							really&nbsp;<em>really</em> love music. And even more than loving music, I love sharing music and maybe
							introducing others to their new favorite artist. If I recall, correctly, Steve’s compilations were more
							Adult Contemporary in scope. If I were to describe my interpretation it would be kind of all over the
							place: eclectic.</p>
						<p>In addition to fulfilling the music nerd in me, this process also fulfills me, as a designer. I get to
							design for my favorite thing: music. For the most part, each cover’s design is rather simple. For the past
							few years, I’ve removed color; as I’ve chosen to use a back-and-white toner-based printer instead of a
							color ink jet. I can be fairly pragmatic, at times, I suppose. Also clearly at the forefront has been
							typography decisions. Clear and bold seems to have dominated several years. As you can see,
							themes/templating tended to stick around for more than one year.</p>
						<h4>Definition.</h4>
						<p>
							<strong>Grangler</strong>
								(<em>noun/adjective)</em>
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>A type&nbsp;of person who finds beauty, appreciation, and substance in a wide variety of artistic
								exploration through&nbsp;any creative medium.</li>
							<li>A qualifying adjective seeking to describe admiration for a large variety of music.</li>
						</ol>

						<p>The origin of my own use and definition of <a
								href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/author.php?author=George+Hower"><em>Grangler</em> dates back to my
								early twenties and the use of its preceding&nbsp;term <em>Grangley</em></a>. My friend Ben used
							“Grangle” as a term (I don’t recall his meaning) and I repurposed it to <em>Grangley</em>. I then used the
							word to describe “beautifully ugly” color schemes. e.g.&nbsp;<em>Grangley</em> color schemes,
							g<em>rangley</em> orange, etc.</p>

						<p>Today, I define the word as a succinct way of referring to an individual who finds beauty/appreciation
							within things/objects/ideas one might not typically find beauty within.

								<p>The first year very little of the music contained on the playlists were released that year. Instead I
									opted to ease-into <em>my</em> ultimate vision for these annual playlists and learn as I went along.
									The songs here were mostly timeless classics that anyone <em>should</em> appreciate in one way or

								<p>Year three contained all 2010-specific music, despite retaining the “new and old” disclaimer adorning
									the artwork. This collection of songs is predominantly r&amp;b/soul based. The year saw great releases
									from local hip-hop collective extraordinaire, <strong>Doomtree</strong>; with songs/albums from
									<strong>Dessa</strong>, <strong>P.O.S</strong>, <strong>Paper Tiger</strong>,
									<strong>Lazerbeak</strong>, and the Doomtree-contributing supergroup <strong>Gayngs</strong>, which is
									made up of all kinds of Minneapolis awesomeness. Sprinkled throughout the Doomtree madness is a mix of

								<p><strong>Active Child</strong> ushers us into this series. Like an all-too-familiar voice/style
									bringing you back to the early 90s. Everything about Active Child, from his voice to production style
									reminds me of the early 90s/ late 80s for some reason.</p>
								<p>Who knew <strong>Frank Ocean</strong> would go on to release what could be his only masterpiece in
									2012’s <em>Channel Orange</em>. I say that half-serious, as&nbsp;<a
										href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/11-artists-who-need-to-drop-a-new-album-like-now_563bcc8be4b0411d3070467f">the
										internet has been going nuts</a> about his sophomore album’s announced release date of July 2015
									coming and going with no further word from Frank. At any rate, man this was a great year for music.
								</p>
								<p>Before the <strong>Weeknd</strong> went pop and slayed the mainstream with pairs of earworm-inducing
									songs: <em>I Can’t Feel My Face</em> and <em>The Hills</em>, he wore his troubles more prominently for
									all to see. <strong>Abel Tesfaye&nbsp;</strong>finally figured out how to mix his misogynistic psycho
									sexual brand of r&amp;b with the right amount of socially acceptable, eccentricity? Great! Now mix in
									a winning pop formula, his always-great vocals and you have the next pop sensation. All an early
									20-something needs to self destruct, eh? Glad the world is giving him all kinds of ammo. I’m
									conflicted: I want to like him, but he’s so unlikeable it’s laughable to even consider liking him. One
									can not deny his talent. I am forever stuck in a sadistic paradox. One thing is certain, Tesfaye’s
									more rough corners; his darkest lyrics, and creepiest production have been reduced to almost
									unrecognizable versions of themselves. Like something pretty, only hinting at being dark and creepy –
									instead of being overtly dark and upfront about his intentions. I’m not sure which is worse. Wow, what
									a tangent that happened there. Anyway,&nbsp;<em>High For This</em> still remains an incredible song.
									The epicness and sharp contrast still echoes in my head and now I can’t feel my face.</p>
								<p>These volumes decidedly closed with two of my favorite <strong>James Blake&nbsp;</strong>songs of the
									year. First with a swirrling jarrer of hypnotism <em>I Never Learnt To Share</em>. Then, volume 8
									closes with the unreal <strong>Joni Mitchell&nbsp;</strong>cover <em>A Case of You</em>. His version
									<a title="James Blake and Joni Mitchell - Typography in Music"
										href="https://joetower.com/2012/06/typography-in-music-joni-mitchell/">still destroys me</a>.</p>

								<p><strong>Graveyard’s</strong> third album didn’t strike me like their 2nd, but it’s still enjoyable.
									Their brand of sludgy psychedelic blues rock is still unmistakably Graveyard.</p>
								<p><strong>Katatonia</strong> released another incredible album, in <strong>Dead End Kings</strong>.</p>
								<p>I’ve been a fan of <strong>Macklemore</strong> since 2009’s <em>Unplanned Mixtape EP</em>. But I
									really started paying close attention when he and Ryan Lewis put out 2010’s <em>The VS</em> and
									<em>The VS Redux</em>. <em>Vipassana</em> was my jam. It’s been several years, but I swear he put out
									a <em>The VS</em> EP and some months later repackaged it with remixed in <em>The VS Redux</em> but I
									can’t find a real instance of <em>The VS</em> by itself (need to keep googling).</p>
								<p>So now, in 2012, they come along and release an album that would catapult them beyond their own
									ambitions. Of course, the record didn’t truly hit its stride until 2013 – because not everyone keeps a
									close watch on underground-to-mainstream artist transitions.</p>
								<p><strong>P.O.S</strong> released his most polarizing record – an odd mix of I don’t know how to
									describe, tracks, in <em>We Don’t Even Live Here</em>. From some solid, truly great songs (the couple
									I included here) to vulgar craziness –<em>Fuck Your Stuff</em>, this album still leaves me scratching
									my head a bit. It’s now 2015 and I should probably re-visit this record.</p>

								<h2 id="volumes-11-amp-12">2013 : Volumes 11 &amp; 12</h2>
								<p><strong>Earl Sweatshirt</strong> emerged from seclusion to unprecedented internet pressure and hype.
									His debut full-length is exactly what it was meant to be; a brilliant young artist throwing something
									out there and seeing how it’s received. While not all of the record hit me like <em>Chum</em>did, it’s
									still a great record. Though, I have to empathize a bit and try to put myself in his world view to
									appreciate the record. Even then, I fall short – being a white guy who largely grew up in the suburbs
									and experienced very little economic/societal struggle. I can only empathize so much. What I do know
									is that Earl will only get better. I look forward to hearing what he’s talking about years from now.
								</p>
								<p><strong>Chvrches</strong> debut record was refreshing, great even. Very inline with 2013’s fresh take
									on older genres – the cycle of influence, if you will. Its inclusion here was a no-brainer – both in
									terms of quality and sequencing. Unfortunately, I can’t say the same will be true for songs on 2015’s
									release <em>Every Open Eye</em>. Too much of the same for me. They have such a niche sound. One whose
									longevity was uncertain from the beginning. I’m reminded, not in style, but by a shared niche sound
									longevity sentiment in <strong>Alt-J</strong>’s material. Both, to me, are almost unlistenable now.
									I’m not sure why that is. Maybe I didn’t really ever like them that much in the first place. Ha,
									ramble ramble.</p>
								<p>On a similar note, <strong>London Grammer</strong> and <strong>Haim</strong> saw much commercial and
									critical success. 2014 was an interesting year for debut female-fronted records. I’m a big fan of all
									of that.</p>
								<p>Local hometown hero (and as of 2015, MN homeowner and resident once again!) <strong>Har Mar
										Superstar</strong> saw his most commercial success. It also saw his most serious, well-formed,
									consistently thematic work in<strong>Bye Bye 17</strong>. Gone are the silly, playful party lyrics,
									what remains is the heart and soul of Har Mar’s world.</p>
								<p><strong>James Blake</strong> returned and absolutely crushed his debut record – albeit in very
									different genre distinction confines. His confidence in singing ability, overall musicianship,
									songwriting is all radically on-point and thoroughly engaging. I’m still holding out for <em>Radio
										Silence&nbsp;</em>his third full-length record to be released in 2015. We’ll see. James Blake and
									Frank Ocean: please release new albums this year. Pull a D’Angelo for 2015.</p>

								<p><strong>D’Angelo</strong> released his incredible third album, randomly, in December of 2014. His
									songs just snuck into their places. This, as I always strive to achieve, is a very eclectic mix of
									genres.</p>
								<p><strong>Thom Yorke</strong> partnered with <strong>Bit Torrent</strong> to try out a new music
									delivery mechanism – well, new to the legal side of music downloading, that is. I’m not sure if Bit
									Torrent was successful in delivering more albums to music-hungry fans, but I know Thom’s album
									downloaded quickly and the process went smoothly. What is unfortunate is that the album itself didn’t
									land how anyone really anticipated. There was barely mention of Thom’s album on internet
									year-end-best-lists. That’s too bad, but I too agree, it wasn’t up to par with <em>The Eraser</em>.
								</p>
								<h3 id="on-sequencing">On sequencing:</h3>
								<p>I’m big on opening and closing with strong, memorable, songs. I’d like every track to be memorable,
									but I like framing the sequence with solid bookends. At times I feel a more jarring genre
									juxtaposition in song-to-song transition pairings is in order, and at other times find a more seamless
									glide appropriate. Point being, sequencing matters, and I try to approach every year differently.</p>

								<p>This year I made it a goal to have fewer repeat artists than previous years. Just my luck, the year
									produced some truly incredible records.</p>
								<p><strong>Nils Frahm</strong> released a wonderful, free, <strong>Solo</strong> piano album. Volume 15
									opens with one of my favorite piano pieces <em>ode</em> and Volume 16 closes with another favorite
									<em>Some</em>. Both pieces feel like great bookends to the series this year. If you would like to have
									the whole album,&nbsp;<a title="Download Nils Frahm&#39;s Solo album"
										href="http://www.nilsfrahm.com/works/sol/">download it here</a>.</p>
								<p><strong>Son Little</strong> released his debut solo album this year. I really can’t say enough great
									things about this guy and his band. They are crazy talented and exude soul. Maggie and I had the
									privilege of seeing them perform at 7th Street this year. We were not disappointed. I wrote about Son
									Little <a title="Son Little Recent Records 5"
										href="https://joetower.com/2015/10/recent-records-05/">earlier this year</a>.</p>
								<p><strong>Courtney Barnett</strong> is sure to be at the top of many “best of” lists. It’s easy to see
									why; as this record is superb.</p>
								<p><strong>Kamasi Washington</strong>’s <em>The Epic</em> is also a sure-to-top “best of” lists. This is
									one of the most subgenre-spanning jazz records I’ve ever heard. It’s also one of the best modern jazz
									records I’ve heard, period. I wrote about Kamasi <a title="Kamasi Washington Recent Records 2"
										href="https://joetower.com/2015/05/recent-records/">earlier this year</a>.</p>
								<p><strong>Sufjan Stevens</strong> writes beautiful music. This record might be his most crushingly
									depressing records to date. It’s also his best album to date.</p>
								<p><strong>Chelsea Wolfe</strong> also released her best album to date, in the excellent<em>The
										Abyss</em> release. Her sound is so much fuller sounding than previous records. I wrote about
									Chelsea <a title="Chelsea Wolfe Recent Records 4"
										href="https://joetower.com/2015/09/recent-records-04/">earlier this year</a>.</p>
								<p>I had to include <strong>Drake</strong>’s thoroughly ridiculous but amazingly catchy campy smash hit
									that everyone parodied or covered. I can’t even call this a guilty pleasure. It’s just a wonderful
									awful great song.</p>
								<p><strong>Floating Points</strong> came out of nowhere to put out one of the year’s most interesting
									electronic albums – brilliantly fusing jazz/glitch/ambient sounds.</p>
								<p><strong>Miguel</strong> put out one of my more immediate favorite fun records of the year. I feel
									like he’s finally shedding his more pop-filled previous records and challenging himself, creatively.
								</p>
								<p><strong>Dollarstore Keyboard</strong> is a childhood friend’s (Colin Swenson) latest music project.
									Colin is an exceptional musician and I always look forward to hearing what he comes up with. This is
									definitely the most remarkable body of work he’s produced to date.</p>

								</div>
								<h2 id="volumes-15-amp-16">2016 : Volumes 17 &amp; 18</h2>
								<p>2016 was a great year for music and not the greatest, otherwise. We lost several incredible music
									legends: Leonard Cohen, David Bowie, Sharon Jones, Prince, Merle Haggard, Phife Dawg, Maurice White,
									Glenn Frey, and other lesser known artists.</p>
								<p>The year was riddled with social justice and injustice, racism/hatred/sexual assault in our
									society&nbsp;and one of the most disgusting presidential elects history will have ever witnessed,
									acknowledged and knowingly <em>chosen</em>. I have a lot of feelings about our country electing a
									narcissist and how bad things could really get under his presidency.&nbsp;But let’s keep this about
									the music and hope, if nothing else good comes out of the next 4 years, music and love will prevail.
									FDT.</p>
								<h2>Volume 17: comments &amp; notes</h2>
								<p><strong>Har Mar Superstar</strong>‘s&nbsp;record this year,&nbsp;<em>Best Summer Ever</em> is his
									most serious and consistent record yet. The album opener, which also opens this year’s Grangler Music
									Series, is quite the memorable emotionally-charged single. I love everything about it – the optimism,
									the simple sentiment found in dancing for joy and reflecting on appreciation. For me&nbsp;<em>I
										Hope</em> represents my feelings toward the future; both near and far.</p>
								<p><strong>Son Little</strong> is the best. I have so much love and admiration for Aaron Livingston, his
									band, and this incarnation of his musical voice in Son Little. While his only new music output this
									year is this (too-short-in-length) single, <em>All Wet,</em>&nbsp;right here, man is this a fantastic
									song. The chorus and melody echo in my head for days. This is my 2016 jam.</p>
								<p><strong>Woods</strong> found me this year and their timing was perfect. This new record seems to be
									their most consistent to date.&nbsp;<em>Sun City Creeps</em> has been on steady rotation throughout
									the year. So much to love about it – from the mariachi horns, to the memorable vocals and melody, to
									the stellar muted guitar twangs, the groove is strong with this one.</p>
								<p><strong>Bibio</strong>&nbsp;is exceptional at evoking a time and place for me.&nbsp;Similar to how
									<strong>Bon Iver</strong> makes me feel while listening to his music, Bibio /&nbsp;Stephen Wilkinson
									evokes feelings of nostalgia in me. For some reason, <em>Town &amp; Country&nbsp;</em>makes me feel as
									though I’m living in a small Italian town, with modest means and an honorably comfortable life.
									Several of the other songs that make up <em>A Mineral Love</em>&nbsp;evoke nostalgic feelings of
									shopping at Goodwill with my father, as a child. That’s a weird range of nostalgic feelings, but they
									are there to feel.</p>
								<p><strong>Jinsang</strong> provides some breathing room in his instrumental work found here. As of
									writing this text, December 23rd, he just released a new album on <a
										href="https://jinsangbeats.bandcamp.com/album/life">Bandcamp</a>. It sounds great so far! I know
									very little about Jinsang other than the fact that his instrumental beat work is exceptional and
									receiving a lot of attention and love on Bandcamp. He’s got the boom bap flavor locked down in 2016.
								</p>
								<p><strong>Kadhja Bonet</strong> was also a discovery from <a
										href="http://kbonet.com/album/the-visitor">Bandcamp</a> where her debut full-length&nbsp;record has
									been met with much critical acclaim.&nbsp;<em>Honeycomb</em> feels measured and precise but also has a
									casual flow to it – perhaps it’s her seemingly effortless silky delivery. This record oozes 70s vibes
									all over the place. Lush orchestration, jazz feels, and lounge atmosphere permeate every square
									inch&nbsp;of the room its being played within.</p>
								<p><strong>Jack Garratt</strong> is a remarkable artist. He has an incredible talent for composing
									dancehall jams, epic hooks, playing multiple instruments very well and he varies things up enough to
									keep this debut full length interesting. The stand out single found here&nbsp;<em>Breathe Life</em> is
									one of my favorite “happy jams” of the year. The way he presents, manipulates, and varies the same
									melody and vocals in a looping fashion works so well. When I initially listened
									to&nbsp;<em>Phase,</em> I unfairly dismissed Jack’s sound as being akin to a far more popular –
									mainstream focused&nbsp;<strong>James Blake</strong>. While the comparison isn’t unwarranted – both
									have heavy roots in the UK dance scene, albeit differing in sub-genre, but similar. Both artist have
									remarkable compositions &nbsp;and vocals.&nbsp;Both utilize looping to manipulate/repeat/reinterpret
									the same vocal lyrics in several ways.&nbsp;<strong>James&nbsp;</strong>operates on the more bleakly
									beautiful end of the spectrum, while <strong>Jack </strong>evokes similar feels but is&nbsp;largely
									more upbeat and radiates positivity.</p>
								<p><strong>Frank Ocean</strong> made quite the resurgence this year – releasing not one, but two new
									bodies of work.&nbsp;<em>Endless</em> being a video album only and has still not been released in a
									format one can purchase (really unfortunate).&nbsp;<em>Blonde</em> being his self-released sophomore
									follow up to 2013’s&nbsp;<em>Channel Orange</em>. Blonde’s reach and range goes well beyond my hopes
									for a second album. It requires several listens to sink in and reveal itself to you. There are plenty
									of layers to appreciate, observe, and love.&nbsp;<em>Ivy</em> is a love story anyone can relate to,
									but does far more than scratch the surface of love as a typical sweet pop song would.&nbsp;<em>I
										thought that I was dreaming when you said you loved me / I had no chance to prepare / I couldn’t see
										you coming</em></p>
								<p><strong>Childish Gambino</strong> surprised everyone this year by abandoning his rap delivery
									and&nbsp;releasing his third commercial full-length as a straight up r&amp;b funk worship affair. Also
									surprising is that he chose to associate the album with his punchline-rap persona of Childish Gambino.
									Donald Glover has had an incredible year – from his critically acclaimed
									series&nbsp;<em>Atlanta,&nbsp;</em>to landing a role as <strong>Lando Calrissian</strong> in the
									upcoming standalone Han Solo Star Wars movie, and now releasing what many are hailing as an album of
									the year. This record is a head scratcher, but a good one. His vocal range doesn’t always feel as
									refined and fluid as I’d like it to, but I think that will come with time. I hope he keeps evolving
									down this musical path. It suits him so much better than the punchline rap game. I’m super excited to
									see what the <a href="https://awakenmylove.com/products/vinyl-inventory">VR Vinyl edition</a>
									of&nbsp;<em>Awaken, My Love!</em> sounds and looks like.&nbsp;<em>Redbone&nbsp;</em>oozes sexy funk
									soul worship goodness.</p>
								<p><strong>Sleepdealer</strong> is another solid beat producer found on <a
										href="https://sleepdealerbeats.bandcamp.com/album/yerba">Bandcamp</a>. His latest record is a solid
									collection of beachy, somewhat stoner, beats that flow nicely as the soundtrack to your work day or
									chilling out on the weekend.</p>
								<p><strong>Cass McCombs</strong> is an artist that I feel silly having not discovered more recently than
									this eighth full-length release,&nbsp;<em>Mangy Love.&nbsp;</em>After several listens I find his
									smooth production, smart lyrics, and memorable hooks very impressive.&nbsp;<em>Bum bum bum</em> serves
									as a solid somewhat political piece that&nbsp;provides one of my favorite understated hooks of 2016.
									Lyrically, it aligns well with the subsequent <strong>Sampha</strong> track,&nbsp;<em>Blood on
										Me.&nbsp;</em>That was purposeful sequencing right there.</p>
								<p><strong>Sampha</strong> is yet another hit-or-miss artist with so much potential oozing from every
									corner. To date, <strong>Sampha Sissay</strong> has released a couple EPs and gained recognition for
									his work with the collective known as&nbsp;<strong>SBTRKT</strong>, of which his vocal contributions
									have been wonderful. The question has always been whether he can sustain himself, stylistically, for
									an entire full-length record. Come February 3rd, 2017, we’ll find out if&nbsp;<em>Blood on Me</em> was
									an accurate expectation setter.</p>
								<p><strong>A Tribe Called Quest</strong> lost Phife Dawg this year, but released an incredible album
									(their first in 18 years) that largely honors Phife’s memory. Without a doubt,&nbsp;<em>We Got It from
										Here… Thank You 4 Your Service</em> is one of the best hip-hop records of the year. It’s full of
									nostalgic voices, timely social commentary and advocacy, while being tremendously enjoyable and fun.
								</p>
								<p><strong>Eldamar</strong> released his first full-length record,&nbsp;<em>The Force of the Ancient
										Land</em>, which is largely inspired by the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien. This record,
									yet&nbsp;<em>another</em> <a
										href="https://eldamar.bandcamp.com/album/the-force-of-the-ancient-land">Bandcamp</a> discovery, is
									an eclectic mix of black metal, atmospheric musical passages, and unique instrumentation and ambient
									compositions. Super excited to see where this project leads.</p>
								<p><strong>Damien Jurado</strong> makes me want to take a road trip and provide the soundtrack to the
									journey.&nbsp;<em>Walrus</em> has an urgent and rugged twang to it; rough in all the right places with
									enough swagger to <em>go&nbsp;back the city, now.</em></p>
								<p><strong>James Blake</strong>‘s third record is a bit of a head scratcher to me. Its anticipation was
									insurmountable.&nbsp;<em>The&nbsp;Color in Anything</em> is a mixed bag to me. There are some truly
									remarkable vocal performances and compositions, but overall it suffers for its meandering and lengthy
									run time.&nbsp;<em>Timeless</em> is one of the best songs on the record and been one, of a handful,
									that demanded repeat plays throughout the year.</p>
								<p><strong>Alcest</strong>‘s fifth record, <em>Kodama</em>, offers little in the way of ground breaking
									material. What it excels at is offering a well-rounded showcase that plays to and exhibits all of
									Alcest’s greatest strengths.&nbsp;<em>Notre Sang Et Nos Pensées (Our Blood and Our
										Thoughts)&nbsp;</em>is a bonus track on the record, but I found it to be&nbsp;a clear highlight and
									the runtime was right.</p>
								<p><strong>Phoria</strong>‘s&nbsp;<em>Melatonin<strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>is low-fi ambient goodness.
									From the hypnotic beat and keyboards to quiet broad-range vocals, this track is so easy to
									love.&nbsp;<strong>Phoria</strong>‘s debut record is so impressive. Put it on some quiet afternoon and
									enjoy subtle background music. Throw on some headphones and take in all the nuance this record has to
									offer.</p>
								<p><strong>Anderson .Paak</strong> has had a huge year – from his standout second&nbsp;record (as
									Anderson .Paak), <em>Malibu</em> to his <i>Yes Lawd!</i>&nbsp;collaboration with producer Knowledge as
									the duo <strong>NXWorries</strong>, he’s been a busy guy. As a record,&nbsp;<em>Malibu</em> has some
									truly remarkable music. It’s a mix of great ideas, some great execution, some so-so songwriting and
									some pretty wonderful songwriting. It overall leaves a positive impression, if a bit
									uneven.&nbsp;<em>The Bird</em> is such a fantastic album opener to <em>Malibu</em>, I knew it had to
									be included somewhere here. It features the very best of .Paak’s r&amp;b soul sound. He oozes
									potential and I can not wait to hear more from him.</p>
								<p>What more can anyone say about&nbsp;<strong>Bon Iver / Justin Vernon?&nbsp;</strong>His sound is so
									unmistakable and so hard to reproduce – though plenty have tried.&nbsp;<em>22, A Million</em> is an
									unforeseen progression in Bon Iver’s sound. It’s fractured, deceptively complex, and mostly a good
									record.&nbsp;<em>“33” God</em>&nbsp;is an epic slow burn composition that breaks into such beautiful
									space vocal passages and instrumentation.</p>

								<h2>Volume 18: comments &amp; notes</h2>
								<p><strong>Tycho</strong> opens this volume,&nbsp;<em>gliding</em> you into the record. While<em>
										Epoch</em>, his fourth&nbsp;proper release, and second with a backing band, isn’t as consistent and
									strong as 2014’s masterpiece <em>Awake</em>, it is an exceptional record that takes more
									compositionally meandering risks. It’s nice to see them trying something a bit different and pushing
									themselves, creatively.</p>
								<p><strong>Agnes Obel</strong> has continued evolving&nbsp;with each release. Some artists never surpass
									their full length debuts, while others surpass each consecutive release with their best work. Sure,
									all of this is subjective and victim to the listeners emotional state. It’s all relative to you and
									your life. But I find this third album,&nbsp;<em>Citizen of Glass</em> to be her best work yet. Opting
									to use less piano and more varied/old/rare keyboard equipment produces a more dense, more challenging
									and more rich sound. Her vocal performance has never been better, either.&nbsp;<em>Stretch Your
										Eyes</em> opens&nbsp;<em>Citizen of Glass</em> with a slow brooding flow. Her vocals&nbsp;stretch
									between comfortable whisper to grand operatic epic ness.</p>
								<p><strong>Jean-Michel Blais</strong>, yet another <a
										href="https://jeanmichelblais.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a> discovery, released a collection of
									incredible and intimate solo piano compositions. They are rich with atmosphere and simplicity. I find
									so much beauty and emotive range in his composition and playing style. There is so much to love
									here.&nbsp;<em>il&nbsp;</em>is just the first stand out composition from his record <em>II.</em></p>
								<p>I’ve never been a huge fan of <strong>Andrew Bird</strong>. Maybe I didn’t start with the right
									album, or was in a different subjective headspace when listening to him previously.
									Maybe&nbsp;<em>Left Handed Kisses</em> serves as the basis for me paying attention to this latest
									release,&nbsp;<em>Are You Serious.&nbsp;</em>A lot of that admiration has to do with Left Handed
									Kisses being a duet with the incredible&nbsp;<strong>Fiona Apple&nbsp;</strong>and the equally magical
									<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZwtWExDmoI">music video</a>. The lyric and vocal tradeoff is
									spectacular and climactic. The music video is a joy to watch.</p>
								<p><strong>Shura</strong>‘s debut record is solid.&nbsp;<em>What Happened To Us?</em> happens to be my
									favorite song&nbsp;on the album and flows nicely as an 80s throwback catchy pop tune. Poppy nostalgic
									bliss.</p>
								<p><strong>Rihanna</strong> released one of the more subdued critically divided recorded of the year.
									Originally it was viewed as a commercial failure. I’m not the biggest Rihanna fan, and found the first
									lead single <em>Work</em> to be obnoxiously catchy&nbsp;but mostly obnoxious.&nbsp;<em>Needed Me</em>
									kind of prompted me to give Anti more serious listens and I mostly really enjoy the
									record.&nbsp;<em>Desperado&nbsp;</em>might be my very favorite track on <em>Anti</em> and one of my
									favorite should’ve-been-a-single tracks of the year. Her delivery is so spot on and the melody is
									understatedly catchy as all get out.</p>
								<p><strong>Yeasayer</strong>‘s fourth record, <em>Amen &amp; Goodbye</em>&nbsp;is a mixed bag. There are
									a handful of tracks I really enjoy, but it mostly falls flat.&nbsp;I was torn between
									including&nbsp;<em>Silly Me</em> or&nbsp;<em>Dead Sea Scrolls,&nbsp;</em>opting for the latter due to
									having less plays over the year than the former.</p>
								<p><strong>Coldworld</strong> hasn’t released an album since 2008’s debut
									masterpiece&nbsp;<em>Melancholie²</em>. I’m happy his second record isn’t a rehash or stylistic match.
									It’s an evolution. It’s a different beast altogether. I’ve included one of the most accessible songs
									on this compilation in <em>The Wind and the Leaves</em>&nbsp;– partially due to its short runtime in
									comparison to the rest of its album’s track, but also due to the absence of divisive growling vocals.
								</p>
								<p><strong>Pinegrove</strong> is yet another <a href="https://pinegrove.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a>
									discovery. There have been a handful of other rock records I’ve loved this year, but to me, Pinegrove
									resonated the most significantly, from a lyrical perspective.&nbsp;<em>Cadmium’s&nbsp;</em><a
										href="https://pinegrove.bandcamp.com/track/cadmium">lyrics</a> speak to the heart of all conflict:
									communication and human relationships- noting:&nbsp;<em>say what it is &nbsp;/&nbsp;it’s so impossible
										/&nbsp;but if i just say what it is /&nbsp;it tends to sublimate away /&nbsp;when i was looking to
										drop /&nbsp;my life away.&nbsp;</em>One may infer from the somewhat oblique language that labels and
									definitions are subjective – so saying “what it is” is forever an exercise in futility because “what
									it is” is so subjective. Who do we define and label things for, anyway?</p>
								<p><strong>Aesop Rock</strong> released one of the most accessible and enjoyable albums of his career.
									He also managed to interweave very personal stories from his life in the music
									industry.&nbsp;<em>Kirby</em> is all about his cat. It’s a cute story.</p>
								<p><strong>Beyonce</strong> stunned the world by releasing her masterful revenge concept/video album in
									<em>Lemonade</em>.&nbsp;I have a lot of respect for this record; both as a audio/visual experience and
									story and for the very public display of therapy-in-progress.&nbsp;<em>Forward</em> consists of
									95%&nbsp;<strong>James Blake</strong> and is perfectly placed in the storyline; serving as a strong
									transition to push things forward. Its inclusion, over other <em>Lemonade</em> tracks, in the sequence
									here has more to do with the resounding need for us, as a society, to push things forward. Now more
									than ever. Glad she and Jay could move forward, too.</p>
								<p><strong>Insomnium</strong> released 2016’s epic concept album <em>Winter’s Gate</em>; reminiscent of,
									in bold scope and execution,&nbsp;<strong>Edge of Sanity</strong>‘s 1996
									masterpiece&nbsp;<em>Crimson.&nbsp;</em>Insomnium sounds incredible here and have possibly never
									sounded better. This fourth <em>Winter’s Gate&nbsp;</em>piece in the story was chosen for its
									instrumentation and clean vocals. The song starts in a manner that suggests its a continuation of
									something that came before it;&nbsp;which is the case with each <em>single</em> track
									on&nbsp;<em>Winter’s Gate.</em> The record is truly meant to be consumed as one whole piece. Perhaps
									this snippet of the story prompts listeners to seek out the full story.</p>
								<p><strong>GoGo Penguin</strong> are a jazz trio I’ve had my ear on for years. Some of their previous
									compositions have struck me as enjoyable and significant, but never to the degree of
									2016’s&nbsp;<em>Man Made Object</em>. And more specifically&nbsp;<em>All Res</em> resonates for its
									melody, passion, and wonderful flowing composition. It serves as an excellent transition both in sound
									and mood from the bleak-but-beautiful Insomnium track before it.</p>
								<p><strong>Cecil Otter</strong> is my second favorite emcee on the emcee side of
									<strong>Doomtree</strong>. He’s also one of my favorite beat makers. His cool, calm, distinctive
									delivery just exudes character. After years of no solo material being released, and no updates
									on&nbsp;<em>Porcelain Revolver</em> (full length follow up to 2008’s <em>Rebel Yellow)&nbsp;</em>it
									was a pleasant surprise to see this EP pop up on <a
										href="https://cecilotter.bandcamp.com/album/dear-echo">Bandcamp</a>.&nbsp;<em>Cross Countries</em>
									was chosen for its travel sentiment. It felt like a road trip with your best friend.</p>
								<p><strong>Winterfylleth</strong>&nbsp;is an atmospheric black metal act that I discovered and since
									obsessed over since listening to&nbsp;<em>The Mercian Sphere</em> on <a
										href="https://winterfylleth.bandcamp.com/album/the-mercian-sphere">Bandcamp</a>. This fourth
									record,&nbsp;<em>The Dark Hereafter</em>, doesn’t rank as my favorite Winterfylleth album to date, but
									there are a few memorable compositions.&nbsp;<em>Ensigns of Victory</em> is the most black metal song
									in this year’s collection. It is also one of my favorites from their newest record.</p>
								<p><strong>Danny Brown</strong> is on another level; a whole other planet that revolves around the world
									as we know it. His delivery isn’t easy to digest and one could say he’s an acquired taste. His
									wordplay is often witty, silly, and always impressive. What’s even more bonkers is the fact
									that&nbsp;<em>anyone&nbsp;</em>can rap over the beats found throughout this third
									record,&nbsp;<em>Atrocity Exhibition.&nbsp;</em> It’s taken me two previous albums to figure out what
									makes Danny Brown so damn special. Maybe he’s matured or my tastes have changed, but this is a
									refreshing record.</p>
								<p><strong>Ian William Craig</strong> ushers the listener into this year’s&nbsp;closing trifecta. The
									gentle electronic melody paired with wonderful vocals sets the mood for what’s to
									come.&nbsp;<em>Arrive, Arrive</em> is 2 minutes of ear candy mood transition.</p>
								<p><strong>Radiohead</strong> released one of their best, most masterfully
									minimal-but-emotionally-charges albums in their discography. It took the better part of the year to
									truly appreciate it as a full record. Possibly because there aren’t the immediately accessible and
									enjoyable songs that one may be accustomed to finding on a Radiohead record. It takes time and space
									to appreciate each composition.&nbsp;<em>Identikit&nbsp;</em>might be my favorite song on the album,
									or at least my favorite while assembling this compilation.</p>
								<p><strong>Frank Ocean</strong> is the only artist this year to have two songs featured. I tried to only
									include one, but it was too hard and Blonde is too good to narrow down song selection to just one
									track. Instead, each volume gets a piece from Frank.&nbsp;<em>White Ferrari</em> absolutely kills me
									in its latter half. The whole production leaves me in awe. Frank is so good at what he does he
									redefines what music is capable of evoking in humans. <em>White&nbsp;Ferrari is&nbsp;</em>almost the
									perfect closer, but then we have David Bowie to truly close out the year in only the way he, himself,
									could have.</p>
								<p><strong>David Bowie</strong>‘s career and life were truly exceptional. He evolved and moved through
									so many creative cycles and phases. As an artist I will alway have so much admiration for his life and
									work. This final record could literally not have been more timely and purposeful in conjunction to his
									passing. Listening to the record before he passed was a truly crushing emotional experience. Listening
									to it after his death brings about whole other levels of purpose and foreshadowing. From the album
									title&nbsp;<em>Blackstar</em> being another name for the type of cancer legion he battled, to the
									after-death dialogue between the living and him, up in heaven. One can not help but be tremendously
									affected by this album. Its overt heft is the only barrier that stopped me from listening to it more
									over the course of the year. The whole album could be dissected and searched for messaging around his
									passing and the duration of the disease the consumed him.&nbsp;It’s a truly remarkable, masterful,
									life-defining, piece of art. What an&nbsp;extraordinary&nbsp;gift to leave us with. It couldn’t have
									been more perfect.</p>
